# Contributing to gts-go

Thank you for your interest in contributing to gts-go! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/user-authentication`
- `fix/memory-leak-in-router`
- `docs/api-gateway-examples`
- `refactor/entity-to-contract-conversions`

### 2. Make Your Changes

Follow the coding standards and patterns described below.

### 3. Run Quality Checks

```bash
...
```

### 4. Commit Changes

Follow a structured commit message format:

```text
<type>(<module>): <description>
```

- `<type>`: change category (see table below)
- `<module>` (optional): the area touched (e.g., api_ingress, modkit, ecommerce)
- `<description>`: concise, imperative summary

Accepted commit types:

| Type       | Meaning                                                     |

Best practices:

- Keep the title concise (ideally â‰¤ 50 chars)
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug", not "Fixed bug")
- Make commits atomic (one logical change per commit)
- Add details in the body when necessary (what/why, not how)
- For breaking changes, either use `feat!:`/`fix!:` or include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer

New functionality development:

- Follow the repository structure in `README.md`
- Prefer soft-deletion for entities; provide hard-deletion with retention routines
- Include unit tests (and integration tests when relevant)

### 5. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear title and description
- Reference to related issues
- Test coverage information
- Breaking changes (if any)
